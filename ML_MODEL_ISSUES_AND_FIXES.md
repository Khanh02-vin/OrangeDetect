# ML Model Issues and Fixes

## Known Issues

### 1. Null Check Error with Non-Orange Images
**Status**: âœ… Fixed

**Issue**: When scanning non-orange images, the app would crash with "Null check operator used on a null value" error.

**Root Cause**: 
- The OrangeClassifier did not properly handle null values and exceptions during image processing
- TensorFlowService lacked error handling for non-orange or invalid images
- UI was not designed to gracefully display error states

**Fix**:
- Added comprehensive null safety checks in OrangeClassifier
- Implemented error handling and recovery in image preprocessing
- Added "Not an Orange" detection for low-confidence classifications
- Enhanced UI to show user-friendly error messages

**Fixed Files**:
- `lib/services/orange_classifier.dart`
- `lib/providers/app_provider.dart`
- `lib/screens/scan_result_screen.dart`

**Detailed Documentation**: 
- See `cursor-memory-bank/optimization-journey/scan_result_screen_fixes.md`

### 2. Mold Detection Failure
**Status**: âœ… Fixed

**Issue**: The app incorrectly classified moldy oranges as "Good Quality" with high confidence.

**Root Cause**:
- The model was using only orange color detection without checking for mold/rot
- Fallback logic automatically defaulted to "Good Quality" when model confidence was low
- Placeholder model (only 248B) was not actually performing classification

**Fix**:
- Added dedicated mold/rot detection based on color analysis
- Modified the classification pipeline to prioritize mold detection results
- Removed automatic "Good Quality" fallbacks when model confidence is low
- Added tests to verify mold detection logic

**Fixed Files**:
- `lib/services/orange_classifier.dart`
- `test/orange_classifier_test.dart`

## Model Limitations

1. The orange classifier model is specifically trained for orange classification and may return unpredictable results for non-orange images.

2. The model requires preprocessing images to 224x224 pixels to match its expected input size.

3. Classification confidence may be low for images with poor lighting or unusual backgrounds.

4. Current mold detection is based on color analysis, not deep learning features. Until the full model is integrated, this approach provides a reasonable stopgap.

## Best Practices

1. **Data Validation**: Always validate input images before processing.

2. **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling at all levels of the ML pipeline.

3. **User Feedback**: Provide clear user feedback when images can't be classified correctly.

4. **Confidence Thresholds**: Set reasonable confidence thresholds (currently 0.3) to filter out low-confidence predictions.

5. **Multiple Detection Methods**: Use both color-based analysis and ML model predictions for more robust results.

## Future Improvements

1. Implement a general object detection model to pre-classify images before using specific models.

2. Add more robust image validation and preprocessing.

3. Improve model with more training data and fine-tuning.

4. Create a fallback classification system for edge cases.

5. Replace color-based mold detection with a dedicated ML model for rot/mold classification.

## New Model Integration

### Kaggle Model Information
**Status**: ðŸ”„ In Progress

**Model Details**:
- Original model: `orange_classifier_cnn_improved.h5` (39.85 MB)
- Source: Kaggle notebook by ngnguynkhnhtrng
- URL: https://www.kaggle.com/code/ngnguynkhnhtrng/ph-n-lo-i-cam-nnkt

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Download the .h5 model from Kaggle
2. Convert the model to TensorFlow Lite format
3. Replace the existing placeholder model in assets/ml_models/
4. Update the labels file if necessary
5. Test the integration with various orange images

**Notes**:
- The current model file is only 248B, likely a placeholder
- The new model will provide more accurate classification
- The existing OrangeClassifier code is already configured for model loading and inference
