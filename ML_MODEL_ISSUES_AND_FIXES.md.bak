# ML Model Issues and Fixes

## Known Issues

### 1. Null Check Error with Non-Orange Images
**Status**: âœ… Fixed

**Issue**: When scanning non-orange images, the app would crash with "Null check operator used on a null value" error.

**Root Cause**: 
- The OrangeClassifier did not properly handle null values and exceptions during image processing
- TensorFlowService lacked error handling for non-orange or invalid images
- UI was not designed to gracefully display error states

**Fix**:
- Added comprehensive null safety checks in OrangeClassifier
- Implemented error handling and recovery in image preprocessing
- Added "Not an Orange" detection for low-confidence classifications
- Enhanced UI to show user-friendly error messages

**Fixed Files**:
- `lib/services/orange_classifier.dart`
- `lib/providers/app_provider.dart`
- `lib/screens/scan_result_screen.dart`

**Detailed Documentation**:

## Model Limitations

1. The orange classifier model is specifically trained for orange classification and may return unpredictable results for non-orange images.

2. The model requires preprocessing images to 224x224 pixels to match its expected input size.

3. Classification confidence may be low for images with poor lighting or unusual backgrounds.

## Best Practices

1. **Data Validation**: Always validate input images before processing.

2. **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling at all levels of the ML pipeline.

3. **User Feedback**: Provide clear user feedback when images can't be classified correctly.

4. **Confidence Thresholds**: Set reasonable confidence thresholds (currently 0.3) to filter out low-confidence predictions.

## Future Improvements

1. Implement a general object detection model to pre-classify images before using specific models.

2. Add more robust image validation and preprocessing.

3. Improve model with more training data and fine-tuning.

4. Create a fallback classification system for edge cases.
